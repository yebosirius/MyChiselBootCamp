    "- It is a good language for hosting an embedded DSL.对于领域特用语言dsl来说,scala是个好东西\n",
    "- It has a powerful and elegant library for manipulating various collections of data.好的变量库\n",
    "- It has a rigorous type system that helps catch a large class of errors very early in the development cycle, i.e. at compilation. 严格的类型定义\n",
    "- It has powerful ways of expressing and passing functions. 牛逼的函数编程方式\n",
    "- Chi*p*el, Chi*j*el, and Chi*c*el don't roll off the tongue as nicely as Chisel does. 好读 Bazinga\n",

It is common practice to use *val* whenever possible.  Why?  Mostly to reduce the chances of re-using variables in ways that are error prone or make your code difficult to read.

    "* Braces ({}) delimit a block of code. Most classes use a code block to define variables, constants, and methods (functions).\n",
    "* `val max: Long =` -- the class contains a member variable **max**, declared as type `Long` and initialized as the class is created.\n",
    "* `(1 << counterBits) - 1` computes the maximum value that can be contained in **counterBits** bits.  Since **max** was created with `val` it cannot be changed.\n",
    "* A variable **counter** is created and initialized to **0L**. The **L** says that 0 is a long value; thus, **counter** is inferred to be Long.\n",
    "* **max** and **counter** are commonly called _member variables_ of the class.\n",
    "* A class method **inc** is defined which takes no arguments and returns a **Long** value.\n",
    "* The body of the method **inc** is a code block that has:\n",
    "  * `counter = counter + 1` increments **counter**.\n",
    "  * `if (counter > max) { counter = 0 }` tests if the counter is greater than the **max** value and sets it back to zero if it is.\n",
    "  * `counter` -- The last line of the code block is important.\n",
    "    * Any value expressed as the last line of a code block is considered to be the return value of that code block. The return value can be used or ignored by the calling statement.\n",
    "    * This applies quite generally; for example, since an `if` then `else` statement defines its true and false clauses with code blocks, it can return a value i.e., `val result = if (10 * 10 > 90) \"greater\" else \"lesser\"` would create a `val` with the value \"greater\".\n",
    "  * So in this case the function **inc** returns the value of **counter**.\n",
    "* `println(s\"counter created with max value $max\")` prints a string to standard output.  Because the **println** is directly in the defining code block, it is part of the class initialization code and is run, i.e. prints out the string, every time an instance of this class is created.\n",
    "* The string printed in this case is an _interpolated_ string.\n",
    "  * The leading **s** in front of the first double quote identifies this as an interpolated string.\n",
    "  * An interpolated string is processed at run time.  \n",
    "  * The **\\$max** is replaced with the value of max.\n",
    "  * If the **\\$** is followed by a code block, arbitrary Scala can be in that code block.\n",
    "    * For example, **`println(s\"doubled max is ${max + max}\")`**.\n",
    "    * The return value of this code block will be inserted  in place of `${...}`.\n",
    "    * ↓这里的意思是说，如果不是一个string类型，那么就会把他转化成string类型，而不是chisel中文站上面说的转化成‘1’\n",
    "    * If the return value is not a string, it will be converted to one; virtually every class or type in scala has an implicit conversion to a string defined).\n",
    "  * You should generally avoid printing something every time an instance of a class is created to avoid flooding standard output, unless you're debugging."

    "The goal here is to help you recognize the different notational types when you encounter them.  As you use Scala, these will seem more comfortable and familiar.  Authors tend to gravitate to particular styles, and there are also individual syntactical situations in which one notation will seem more natural. One-liners tend to use the more concise forms. Complex blocks usually have a more narrative appearance. To make collaboration easier, one should consider skimming through best practices found in the [Scala Style Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/)."

But for less common methods and, in particular, boolean arguments, including the names with calls can make your code a lot more readable. If methods have a long list of arguments of the same type, using names also decreases the chance of error. Parameters to class definitions also use this named argument scheme (they are actually just the parameters to the constructor method for the class).\n",
